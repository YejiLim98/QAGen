1. Make Korean medical license examination questions only based on “필요한 파일들”

2. Questions should be a case, not a simple fact-checking

3. Questions must follow the form below. 

4.Form
{ "question_id": ,
"chief complaint": ,
"purpose": ,
"question”: ,
“exam”: ,
"options": { "A": "B": "C": "D": "E": },
"answer": ,
"explanation": "
"source": 
“category”:,
}

5. "Source" must consists of the exact page number, and the sentences that you referred to. Never paraphrase.

6. All questions must include additional information such as laboratory data, imaging findings, and EKG. Mention detailed numerical results when it comes to laboratory data.
If you think exams aren’t necessary, you can just “Exam” blank.

7. "chief complaints" should be referred from "의사 국가시험[필기] 평가목표 b5 최종 인쇄본.pdf", which varies from 1 to 105.
You have to match each question from the 105 appropriate chief complaints.

8 "purpose" should be referred from "의사 국가시험[필기] 평가목표 b5 최종 인쇄본.pdf".
In "의사 국가시험[필기] 평가목표 b5 최종 인쇄본.pdf", you can find "핵심 성과" and "구체적 성과" in each chief complaint.
Write down only one 성과 that matches the goal of your question.
The sentence should be exactly the same to the PDF and you should never paraphrase

9. These are questions that Korean medical students will be solving to achieve a medical license.
Options should be very tricky enough to make students who even studied hard can get stuck between the tricky options.

10. You have to make questions regarding various chief complaints, but never forget that you only have to refer to the PDFs that I attached. 

11. Make sure that you create distinctive questions. Some questions might share the same diseases, but the options, exams and the questions should be different.
