Common triggers of inflammation in atopic dermatitis include rubbing or scratching, contact with saliva or foods that are acidic, soaps and detergents, fabric softeners, wool or other harsh materials, fragranced personal care products, sweat, highly chlorinated pools, low humidity, tobacco smoke, dust mites, animal dander, environmental pollens, and molds. Exposure to these triggers should be limited whenever possible. Infections that are unrelated to skin disease, such as an upper respiratory infection, can also exacerbate atopic dermatitis. Food allergy is commonly seen in patients with atopic dermatitis but typically presents with urticaria or anaphylaxis rather than exacerbation of the atopic dermatitis.\nPediatrics_Nelson. Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, pruritic, relapsing inflammatory skin condition. The pathogenesis is multifactorial and involves a complex interplay of factors, including genetic predisposition, immunologic abnormalities, disturbances in skin barrier function, environmental interactions, and infectious triggers. Several genes encoding epidermal (filaggrin) or other epithelial structural proteins and genes encoding major elements of the immune system play a major role in atopic dermatitis.\nPediatrics_Nelson. Atopic dermatitis is the most common skin disease in children,with an estimated prevalence of up to 20% of children. Only1% to 2% of adults manifest disease. In addition to genetic factors, an environmental influence contributes. Atopic dermatitisoccurs more frequently in urban areas and in higher socioeconomic classes. Prevalence is lower in areas where industrial pollution is less and where eosinophil-mediated infectionssuch as helminthic infections are endemic. Patients generally have a family history of atopy. Children with atopic dermatitis are predisposed to the development of allergy and allergic rhinitis, referred to as the atopic march. Asthma develops in up to half of children with atopic dermatitis, and allergic rhinitis even more frequently. Food allergies are commonly associated with atopic dermatitis.\nPediatrics_Nelson. Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, relapsing skin disease characterized by xerosis, pruritus, and characteristic skin findings. Thecondition generally improves with age and remits in adulthood,although some childhood cases will continue into adulthood. Characteristic lesions of atopic dermatitis are erythematous papules or plaques with ill-defined borders and overlying scale or hyperkeratosis. Lesions can be secondarily excoriated or have an overlying crust that is yellow or hemorrhagic. Weeping may be present in acute stages. Lichenification is found in older lesions. Formation of fissures is common in both acute and chronic lesions. Temporary hypoand hyperpigmentation can be seen after lesions resolve, but atopic dermatitis is not usually scarring unless secondary features become severe (e.g., infection or physical manipulation [scratching]).\nPediatrics_Nelson. Patients with atopic dermatitis have hyperirritable skin,and many factors can cause the disease to worsen or relapse. Known triggers include anxiety and stress, climate (extremes of temperature and humidity), irritants, allergens, and infections. Approximately 35% to 40% of infants and young children with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis have coexisting food allergies. The more severe the atopic dermatitis and the younger the patient, the more likely a food allergy will be identified as a contributing factor. Egg allergy is the most common cause of food-induced eczematous reactions."

        "source": "InternalMed_Harrison. (Table 72-14) Urticaria (hives) are transient lesions that are composed of a central wheal surrounded by an erythematous halo or flare. Individual lesions are round, oval, or figurate and are often pruritic. Acute and chronic urticaria have a wide variety of allergic etiologies and reflect edema in the dermis. Urticarial lesions can also be seen in patients with mastocytosis (urticaria pigmentosa), hypoor hyperthyroidism, and systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (Still’s disease). In both juvenileand adult-onset Still’s disease, the lesions CAuSES of uRTiCARiA AnD AngioEDEMA I. Primary cutaneous disorders A. Acute and chronic urticariaa B. Physical urticaria 1. 2. 3. 4. C.

Urticarial eruptions are distinctly pruritic, may involve any area of the body from the scalp to the soles of the feet, and appear in crops of 12-to 36-h duration, with old lesions fading as new ones appear. Most of the physical urticarias (cold, cholinergic, dermatographism) are an exception, with individual lesions lasting less than 2 h. The most common sites for urticaria are the extremities and face, with angioedema often being periorbital and in the lips. Although self-limited in duration, angioedemaoftheupper respiratorytractmaybe life-threateningdueto laryngealobstruction,whereasgastrointestinalinvolvementmaypresent with abdominal colic, with or without nausea and vomiting, and may result in unnecessary surgical intervention. No residual discoloration occurs with either urticaria or angioedema unless there is an underlying vasculiticprocessleadingtosuperimposedextravasationoferythrocytes.\nInternalMed_Harrison. Individuals with classic urticaria (“hives”) usually have a hypersensitivity reaction without associated fever. In the presence of fever, urticaria-like eruptions are most often due to urticarial vasculitis (Chap. 385). Unlike individual lesions of classic urticaria, which last up to 24 h, these lesions may last 3–5 days. Etiologies include serum sickness (often induced by drugs such as penicillins, sulfas, salicylates, or barbiturates), connective-tissue disease (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus or Sjren’s syndrome), and infection (e.g., with hepatitis B virus, enteroviruses, or parasites). Malignancy, especially lymphoma, may be associated with fever and chronic urticaria (Chap. 72).\nPathology_Robbins. Urticaria typically affects individuals between 20 and 40 years of age, but no age is immune. Individual lesions usually develop and fade within hours, but episodes can persist for days or even months. Lesions range in size and nature from small, pruritic papules to large, edematous, erythematous plaques. They may be localized to a particular part of the body or generalized. In a specific type of urticaria termed pressure urticaria, lesions are found only in areas exposed to pressure (such as the feet or buttocks). Although not life-threatening, severe pruritus and the social embarrassment of urticaria can compromise quality of life. Most cases respond to antihistamines, but more severe, refractory disease may require treatment with leukotriene antagonists, monoclonal antibodies that block the action of IgE, or immunosuppressive drugs.\nFirst_Aid_Step2. ■Hives can range in severity from a few itchy bumps to life-threatening anaphylaxis. The typical lesion is an elevated papule or plaque that is reddish or white and variable in size. Lesions are widespread and last a few hours. In severe allergic reactions, extracutaneous manifestations can include tongue swelling, angioedema (deeper, more diffuse swelling), asthma, GI symptoms, joint swelling, and fever. Acute urticaria is a response to a trigger that may be a food, drug, virus, insect bite, or physical stimulus. Chronic urticaria is usually idiopathic. Diagnosed by clinical impression and patient report. Biopsy demonstrates perivascular edema. It can often be difficult to determine the cause. Treat with systemic antihistamines. Topical medications are of no benefit."

Common complications of CKD in children are listed in Table 165-5. Most of these complications are multifactorial in etiology. For example, factors associated with growth failure include poor nutrition, renal osteodystrophy (ROD), metabolic acidosis, hormonal abnormalities, and resistance to growth hormone. Anemia results primarily from a failure to produce adequate erythropoietin and iron deficiency. ROD is usually due to secondary hyperparathyroidism as a result of diminished 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D production in the kidney, hypocalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia (from decreased renal excretion). If prolonged and/or severe, ROD may eventually lead to rickets and bone deformities.\nInternalMed_Harrison.

Figure 335-1 provides a recently updated classification, in which stages of CKD are stratified by both estimated GFR and the degree of albuminuria, in order to predict risk of progression of CKD. Previously, CKD had been staged solely by the GFR. However, the risk of worsening of kidney function is closely linked to the amount of albuminuria, and so it has been incorporated into the classification.\nPediatrics_Nelson. Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) are the most common causes of CKD that present between birth and 10 years of age. After age 10 acquired diseases, such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and glomerulonephritis (GN), are more common causes of incident CKD. The risk of progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is related to the underlying cause and severity of CKD. During puberty, renal function may deteriorate if the damaged kidneys are not able to grow and adapt to increased demands. CKD is staged to facilitate appropriate evaluation and monitoring (Table 165-4). The GFR can be estimated in children using the Schwartz formula (see Chapter 161).

        "source": "Pediatrics_Nelson. The clinical presentation of a child with CKD may be related to both the underlying diagnosis and complications of CKD. A child with CAKUT may have polyuria, polydipsia, and recurrent urinary tract infections. A child with glomerular disease may have hematuria, proteinuria, edema, and hypertension. Common complications of CKD in children are listed in Table 165-5. Most of these complications are multifactorial in etiology. For example, factors associated with growth failure include poor nutrition, renal osteodystrophy (ROD), metabolic acidosis, hormonal abnormalities, and resistance to growth hormone. Anemia results primarily from a failure to produce adequate erythropoietin and iron deficiency. ROD is usually due to secondary hyperparathyroidism as a result of diminished 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D production in the kidney, hypocalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia (from decreased renal excretion). If prolonged and/or severe, ROD may eventually lead to rickets and bone deformities.\nInternalMed_Harrison. INITIAL APPROACH History and Physical Examination Symptoms and overt signs of kidney disease are often subtle or absent until renal failure supervenes. Thus, the diagnosis of kidney disease often surprises patients and may be a cause of skepticism and denial. Particular aspects of the history that are germane to renal disease include a history of hypertension (which can cause CKD or more commonly be a consequence of CKD), diabetes mellitus, abnormal urinalyses, and problems with pregnancy such as preeclampsia or early pregnancy loss. A careful drug history should be elicited: patients may not volunteer use of analgesics, for example. Other drugs to consider include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, antimicrobials, chemotherapeutic agents, antiretroviral agents, proton pump inhibitors, phosphate-containing bowel cathartics, and lithium. In evaluating the uremic syndrome, questions about appetite, weight loss, nausea, hiccups, peripheral edema,\nInternalMed_Harrison. when chronic kidney disease is detected during routine evaluation or during pregnancy. Affected adults are frequently asymptomatic, but may give a history of prolonged bed-wetting or recurrent UTIs during childhood, and exhibit variable renal insufficiency, hypertension, mild to moderate proteinuria, and unremarkable urine sediment. When both kidneys are affected, the disease often progresses inexorably over several years to ESRD, despite the absence of ongoing urinary infections or reflux. A single affected kidney may go undetected, except for the presence of hypertension. Renal ultrasound in adults characteristically shows asymmetric small kidneys with irregular outlines, thinned cortices, and regions of compensatory hypertrophy (Fig. 340-4).\nInternalMed_Harrison. Joanne M. Bargman, Karl Skorecki Chronic kidney disease (CKD) encompasses a spectrum of different pathophysiologic processes associated with abnormal kidney function and a progressive decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Figure 335-1 provides a recently updated classification, in which stages of CKD are stratified by both estimated GFR and the degree of albuminuria, in order to predict risk of progression of CKD. Previously, CKD had been staged solely by the GFR. However, the risk of worsening of kidney function is closely linked to the amount of albuminuria, and so it has been incorporated into the classification.\nPediatrics_Nelson. Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) are the most common causes of CKD that present between birth and 10 years of age. After age 10 acquired diseases, such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and glomerulonephritis (GN), are more common causes of incident CKD. The risk of progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is related to the underlying cause and severity of CKD. During puberty, renal function may deteriorate if the damaged kidneys are not able to grow and adapt to increased demands. CKD is staged to facilitate appropriate evaluation and monitoring (Table 165-4). The GFR can be estimated in children using the Schwartz formula (see Chapter 161). Most complications of CKD do not manifest until at least stage 3 CKD. In stage 4 CKD, the complications become more numerous and severe. Children with stage 5 CKD (ESRD) are typically treated with either dialysis or renal transplantation."

A localized pulmonary fungal infection can then remain dormant in the lungs until there is an abnormality in cell-mediated immunity that allows the fungus to reactivate and disseminate to the CNS.

Symptoms vary according to the site affected: Oral candidiasis: Presents with painless white plaques that cannot easily be scraped off. Candidiasis of the skin: Presents as pink, circular, erythematous macules that converge, with smaller satellite lesions seen nearby, often in skin folds. In infants, infection can often be seen in the diaper area and along the inguinal folds. Diagnosed by the clinical picture. Confirmed by KOH preparation of a scraping or swab of the affected area. KOH dissolves the skin cells but leaves the Candida untouched such that candidal hyphae and pseudospores become visible. Oral candidiasis: Oral ﬂuconazole; nystatin swish and swallow. Superficial (skin) candidiasis: Topical antifungals; keep skin clean and dry. Diaper rash: Topical nystatin.\nPharmacology_Katzung. Human fungal infections have increased dramatically in incidence and severity in recent years, owing mainly to advances in surgery, cancer treatment, treatment of patients with solid organ and bone marrow transplantation, the HIV epidemic, and increasing use of broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy in critically ill patients. These changes have resulted in increased numbers of patients at risk for fungal infections.\nInternalMed_Harrison. Fungal infections of the skin and skin structures are caused by molds and yeasts that do not invade deeper tissues but rather cause disease merely by inhabiting the superficial layers of skin, hair follicles, and nails. These agents are the most common cause of fungal infections of humans but only rarely cause serious infections. YEAST INFECTIONS Etiologic Agents The lipophilic yeast Malassezia is dimorphic in that it lives on the skin in the yeast phase but transforms to the mold phase as it causes disease. Most species require exogenous lipids for growth. Epidemiology and Pathogenesis Malassezia species are part of the indigenous human flora found in the stratum corneum of the back, chest, scalp, and face—areas rich in sebaceous glands. Disease is more common in humid areas. The organisms do not invade below the stratum corneum and generally elicit little if any inflammatory response.\nInternalMed_Harrison.

It may be associated with other cutaneous disorders such as AD, and contact with various agents may be involved. Hand eczema represents a large proportion of cases of occupation-associated skin disease. Chronic, excessive exposure to water and detergents, harsh chemicals, or allergens may initiate or aggravate this disorder. It may present with dryness and cracking of the skin of the hands as well as with variable amounts of erythema and edema. Often, the dermatitis will begin under rings, where water and irritants are trapped. Dyshidrotic eczema, a variant of hand eczema, presents with multiple, intensely pruritic, small papules and vesicles on the thenar and hypothenar eminences and the sides of the fingers (Fig. 71-2). Lesions tend to occur in crops that slowly form crusts and then heal.\nPediatrics_Nelson. Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, relapsing skin disease characterized by xerosis, pruritus, and characteristic skin findings. Thecondition generally improves with age and remits in adulthood,although some childhood cases will continue into adulthood. Characteristic lesions of atopic dermatitis are erythematous papules or plaques with ill-defined borders and overlying scale or hyperkeratosis. Lesions can be secondarily excoriated or have an overlying crust that is yellow or hemorrhagic. Weeping may be present in acute stages. Lichenification is found in older lesions. Formation of fissures is common in both acute and chronic lesions. Temporary hypoand hyperpigmentation can be seen after lesions resolve, but atopic dermatitis is not usually scarring unless secondary features become severe (e.g., infection or physical manipulation [scratching]).\nInternalMed_Harrison. Patients with atrophic thyroiditis or the late stage of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis present with symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism. The skin is dry, and there is decreased sweating, thinning of the epidermis, and hyperkeratosis of the stratum corneum. Increased dermal glycosaminoglycan content traps water, giving rise to skin thickening without pitting (myxedema). Typical features include a puffy face with edematous eyelids and nonpitting pretibial edema (Fig. 405-6). There is pallor, often with a yellow tinge to the skin due to carotene accumulation. Nail growth is retarded, and hair is dry, brittle, difficult to manage, and falls out easily. In addition to diffuse alopecia, there is thinning of the outer third of the eyebrows, although this is not a specific sign of hypothyroidism.\nInternalMed_Harrison.

Fine cracks and scale, with or without erythema, characteristically develop in areas of dry skin, especially on the anterior surfaces of the lower extremities in elderly patients.

        "source": "InternalMed_Harrison. Any severe reaction to drugs should be reported to a regulatory agency or to pharmaceutical companies (e.g., MedWatch, http://www.fda.gov/ Safety/MedWatch/default.htm). Because severe reactions are too rare to be detected in premarketing clinical trials, spontaneous reports are of critical importance for early detection of unexpected life-threatening events. To be useful, the report should contain enough details to permit ascertainment of severity and drug causality. This enables recognition of similar cases that may be reported from several different sources. We acknowledge the contribution of Dr. Jean-Claude Roujeau to this chapter in the 17th edition. Photosensitivity and other 75 Reactions to Light Alexander G. Marneros, David R. Bickers\nPediatrics_Nelson.

G6PD, Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. repeated exposure, and a genetic predisposition of slow drug metabolism. An atopic background does not predispose an individual to the development of drug reactions but may indicate a greater risk of serious reaction. Allergic reactions can be classified as immediate (anaphylactic) reactions, which occur within 60 minutes of drug administration; accelerated reactions, which begin l to 72 hours after drug administration; and late reactions, which occur after 72 hours. The most common form of adverse drug reaction is cutaneous. Accelerated reactions are usually dermatologic or serum sickness reactions. Late reactions include desquamating dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and serum sickness.\nInternalMed_Harrison. Illness related to a drug’s intended pharmacologic action is often more easily recognized than illness attributable to immune or other mechanisms. For example, side effects such as cardiac arrhythmias in patients receiving digitalis, hypoglycemia in patients given insulin, or bleeding in patients receiving anticoagulants are more readily related to a specific drug than are symptoms such as fever or rash, which may be caused by many drugs or by other factors. Electronic listings of adverse drug reactions can be useful. However, exhaustive compilations often provide little sense of perspective in terms of frequency and seriousness, which can vary considerably among patients.\nPharmacology_Katzung. E. Adverse Effects\nInternalMed_Harrison. The manifestations of drug-induced diseases frequently resemble those of other diseases, and a given set of manifestations may be produced by different and dissimilar drugs. Recognition of the role of a drug or drugs in an illness depends on appreciation of the possible adverse reactions to drugs in any disease, on identification of the temporal relationship between drug administration and development of the illness, and on familiarity with the common manifestations of the drugs. A suspected adverse drug reaction developing after introduction of a new drug naturally implicates that drug; however, it is also important to remember that a drug interaction may be responsible. Thus, for example, a patient on a chronic stable warfarin dose may develop a bleeding complication after introduction of amiodarone; this does not reflect a direct reaction to amiodarone but rather its effect to inhibit warfarin metabolism. Many associations between particular drugs and specific reactions have been"

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is characterized by hyperglycemia andglycosuria and is an end point of a few disease processes (Table 171-1).

Type 2 DM (DM2) resultsfrom insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency, usuallyin the context of exogenous obesity. The incidence of DM1 andDM2 in the United States is increasing.

In addition, other external factors may exacerbate psoriasis, including infections, stress, and medications (lithium, beta blockers, and antimalarial drugs).\nObstentrics_Williams. Psoriasis is most commonly of the chronic plaque variety. In contrast, with generalized pustuar psoriasis of pregnancy, severe systemic symptoms may develop. Formerly called impetigo herpetiformis, this rare pustular form has erythematous, sometimes pruritic plaques ringed by sterile pustules that enlarge and then crust (Fig. 62-3). Lesions initially involve intertriginous areas but may spread to the torso, extremities, and oral mucosa. Comorbid constitutional symptoms are common. Laboratory testing may reveal hypocalcemia, elevated erythrocte sedimentation rate, leukocytosis, and hypoalbuminemia (Lehrhof, 2013). Extensive lesions can lead to sepsis from secondary infection and to massive fluid loss with hypovolemia and placental insuiciency. First-line treatment is with oral prednisone, cyclosporine, infliximab, topical corticosteroids, or topical calcipotriene (Robinson, 2012). Phototherapy is a second-line option. For secondary infections, intravenous antibiotics are added (Huang,\nInternalMed_Harrison. The most common variety of psoriasis is called plaque-type. Patients with plaque-type psoriasis have stable, slowly enlarging plaques, which remain basically unchanged for long periods of time. The most commonly involved areas are the elbows, knees, gluteal cleft, and scalp. Involvement tends to be symmetric. Plaque psoriasis generally develops slowly and runs an indolent course. It rarely remits spontaneously. Inverse psoriasis affects the intertriginous regions, including the axilla, groin, submammary region, and navel; it also tends to affect the scalp, palms, and soles. The individual lesions are sharply demarcated plaques (see Fig. 70-7), but they may be moist and without scale due to their locations.\nPediatrics_Nelson. Psoriasis is a common papulosquamous condition characterized by well-demarcated, erythematous, scaling papules andplaques. Psoriasis occurs at all ages, including infancy, withonset of 30% of cases during childhood. The disease is characterized by a chronic and relapsing course, although spontaneous remissions can occur. Infections (especially Streptococcus pyogenes), stress, trauma, and medications may cause diseaseexacerbations. Various subtypes of psoriasis exist. The mostcommon variety is plaque-type psoriasis (psoriasis vulgaris), which can be localized or generalized. The lesions consist ofround, well-demarcated, red plaques measuring 1 to 7 cm withmicaceous scale, which is distinctive in its thick, silvery appearance with pinpoint bleeding points revealed on removal of thescales (Auspitz sign). The lesions of psoriasis have a distinctivedistribution involving the extensor aspect of the elbows andknees, posterior occipital scalp, periumbilical region, lumbosacral region, and\nFirst_Aid_Step2.

The diagnosis of scabies can be confirmed by microscopic visualization of the mite, eggs, larvae, or feces in scrapings of papules or burrows examined under oil immersion. Skin biopsy is rarely necessary but may be useful if lesions have become nodular. Curative treatment is achieved by a 12-hour (overnight) application of permethrin 5% cream applied to the entire body.

Items that are not washable may be dry-cleaned or placed in a sealed plastic bag for 7 days.\nInternalMed_Harrison. The itching and rash associated with scabies derive from a sensitization reaction to the mites and their secretions/excretions. A person’s initial infestation remains asymptomatic for up to 6 weeks before the onset of intense pruritus, but a reinfestation produces a hypersensitivity reaction without delay. Burrows become surrounded by inflammatory infiltrates composed of eosinophils, lymphocytes, and histiocytes, and a generalized hypersensitivity rash later develops in remote sites. Immunity and associated scratching limit most infestations to <15 mites per person. Hyperinfestation with thousands of mites, a condition known as crusted scabies (formerly termed Norwegian scabies), may result from glucocorticoid use, immunodeficiency, and neurologic or psychiatric illnesses that limit the itch and/or the scratch response.\nFirst_Aid_Step1.

Pediculus humanus/ Blood-sucking lice that cause intense pruritus Phthirus pubis with associated excoriations, commonly on scalp and neck (head lice), waistband and axilla (body lice), or pubic and perianal regions (pubic lice). Body lice can transmit Rickettsia prowazekii (epidemic typhus), Borrelia recurrentis (relapsing fever), Bartonella quintana (trench fever). Treatment: pyrethroids, malathion, or ivermectin lotion, and nit B combing. Children with head lice can be treated at home without interrupting school attendance.\nInternalMed_Harrison. Within 1 day of effective treatment, scabies infestations become noncommunicable, but the pruritic hypersensitivity dermatitis induced by the now-dead mites and their remnant products frequently persists for weeks. Unnecessary re-treatment with topical agents may provoke contact dermatitis. Antihistamines, salicylates, and calamine lotion relieve itching during treatment, and topical glucocorticoids are useful for pruritus that lingers after effective treatment. To prevent reinfestations, bedding and clothing should be washed and dried on high heat or heat-pressed. Close contacts of confirmed cases, even if asymptomatic, should be treated simultaneously.\nInternalMed_Harrison. The human itch mite, Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis, is a common cause of itching dermatosis, infesting ~300 million persons worldwide at any one time. Gravid female mites (~0.3 mm in length) burrow superficially within the stratum corneum, depositing three or fewer eggs per day. Six-legged larvae mature to eight-legged nymphs and then to adults. Gravid adult females emerge to the surface of the skin about 8 days later and then (re)invade the skin of the same or another host. Newly fertilized female mites are transferred from person to person mainly by direct skin-to-skin contact; transfer is facilitated by crowding, poor hygiene, and sex with multiple partners. Generally, these mites die within a day or so in the absence of host contact. Transmission via sharing of contaminated bedding or clothing occurs far less frequently than is often thought.

Immunity and associated scratching limit most infestations to <15 mites per person. Hyperinfestation with thousands of mites, a condition known as crusted scabies (formerly termed Norwegian scabies), may result from glucocorticoid use, immunodeficiency, and neurologic or psychiatric illnesses that limit the itch and/or the scratch response.\nFirst_Aid_Step1. Associated with cholangiocarcinoma Sarcoptes scabiei Mites burrow into stratum corneum and Common in children, crowded populations cause scabies—pruritus (worse at night) and (jails, nursing homes); transmission through serpiginous burrows (lines) often between skin-to-skin contact (most common) or via fingers and toes A . fomites. Treatment: permethrin cream, washing/drying all clothing/bedding, treat close contacts. Pediculus humanus/ Blood-sucking lice that cause intense pruritus Phthirus pubis with associated excoriations, commonly on scalp and neck (head lice), waistband and axilla (body lice), or pubic and perianal regions (pubic lice). Body lice can transmit Rickettsia prowazekii (epidemic typhus), Borrelia recurrentis (relapsing fever), Bartonella quintana (trench fever). Treatment: pyrethroids, malathion, or ivermectin lotion, and nit B combing. Children with head lice can be treated at home without interrupting school attendance.\nInternalMed_Harrison. Within 1 day of effective treatment, scabies infestations become noncommunicable, but the pruritic hypersensitivity dermatitis induced by the now-dead mites and their remnant products frequently persists for weeks. Unnecessary re-treatment with topical agents may provoke contact dermatitis. Antihistamines, salicylates, and calamine lotion relieve itching during treatment, and topical glucocorticoids are useful for pruritus that lingers after effective treatment. To prevent reinfestations, bedding and clothing should be washed and dried on high heat or heat-pressed. Close contacts of confirmed cases, even if asymptomatic, should be treated simultaneously.\nInternalMed_Harrison. The human itch mite, Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis, is a common cause of itching dermatosis, infesting ~300 million persons worldwide at any one time. Gravid female mites (~0.3 mm in length) burrow superficially within the stratum corneum, depositing three or fewer eggs per day. Six-legged larvae mature to eight-legged nymphs and then to adults. Gravid adult females emerge to the surface of the skin about 8 days later and then (re)invade the skin of the same or another host. Newly fertilized female mites are transferred from person to person mainly by direct skin-to-skin contact; transfer is facilitated by crowding, poor hygiene, and sex with multiple partners. Generally, these mites die within a day or so in the absence of host contact. Transmission via sharing of contaminated bedding or clothing occurs far less frequently than is often thought. In the United States, scabies may account for up to 5% of visits to dermatologists. Outbreaks occur in preschools, hospitals, nursing"

The diagnosis of scabies can be confirmed by microscopic visualization of the mite, eggs, larvae, or feces in scrapings of papules or burrows examined under oil immersion. Skin biopsy is rarely necessary but may be useful if lesions have become nodular. Curative treatment is achieved by a 12-hour (overnight) application of permethrin 5% cream applied to the entire body. Because permethrin is not effective against the eggs, the treatment should be repeated 1 week later to kill any subsequently hatched larvae. All household members and close contacts should be treated simultaneously, even if asymptomatic. Bed linens, towels, and clothes worn for the previous 2 days before treatment should be machine-washed in hot water and machine-dried using high heat; heat is the most effective scabicide. Items that are not washable may be dry-cleaned or placed in a sealed plastic bag for 7 days.\nInternalMed_Harrison. The itching and rash associated with scabies derive from a sensitization reaction to the mites and their secretions/excretions. A person’s initial infestation remains asymptomatic for up to 6 weeks before the onset of intense pruritus, but a reinfestation produces a hypersensitivity reaction without delay.
